This song is played during the 8th inning of every Sun Devil Baseball game (at least it was until recently) and is the inspiration for the title of this blog.</p><blockquote>Fight, Devils down the field!<br/>Fight with your might and don't ever yield.<br/>Long may our colors outshine all others.<br/>Echo from the buttes, <i>give 'em Hell Devils!</i><br/>Cheer, cheer for A–S–U.<br/>Fight for the Old Maroon.<br/>For it's hail, hail, the gang's all here<br/>And it's onward to victory!</blockquote><p>According to <a target=\"wiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_%26_Gold\">Wikipedia</a> (which references a dead link), the song was composed by the former Sun Devil Marching Band Director, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948.</p>",
